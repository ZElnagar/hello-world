# hello-world

👋 Hi there! I'm Ziad, a second-year Software Engineering student at Western University. I'm passionate about programming and love exploring different aspects of software development, from writing clean code to designing robust systems. My GitHub is where I share my learning journey, projects, and experiments as I dive deeper into the world of technology.

🛠️ I'm currently sharpening my skills in:

Java, Python, and experimenting with React every now and then
Web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Exploring data structures, algorithms, and software design principles
🌱 I’m also learning about open-source contributions and always looking for new challenges to improve my skills.

💬 Feel free to connect, collaborate, or just say hello! Let's build something amazing together!
